BreastCancerDetection
This project is a breast cancer detection system that uses image processing and YOLOv8-based classification on medical images. The model analyzes images and classifies them into three categories: benign, malignant, and normal, and presents the results through a user interface.
Classes:
Benign – Non-cancerous tumor
Malignant – Cancerous tumor
Normal – Healthy tissue
Features
Automatic classification of breast cancer images
YOLOv8-based model
Predicted class label with risk percentage output
User interface built with Gradio
Model Development
Data labeling and augmentation were performed by me using Roboflow.
Model training was completed on Google Colab.
The best trained model (.pt file) was integrated into the application.
Dataset:
An open-source breast cancer image dataset was used.
All labeling and data augmentation processes were performed by me.
Technologies Used:
Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, and image processing techniques.
Note:
This project was developed for educational and research purposes.
